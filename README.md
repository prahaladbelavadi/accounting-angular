# Accounting

This is meant to keep track of the following:
- Attendance
- Number of hours worked
- Amount of money each person is due to be paid
- Check list of tasks to be assigned for a particular day of the calendar day
- A todo list to check if tasks were completed for the particular day.

## Development server

The codebase has the following features:
- Provides tabulated record of how many hours each one has worked and how much each person is due to be paid.
- Provides a record of disimbursement of cash for people worked
- Provides an accountability of tasks done, scheduled and yet to be done if pre determined.

## Code scaffolding

The front end structure is as follows:
- Componenents:
  - Dashboard component
- Services

## Build

The current version has deummy data in a sorted table at `/dashboard` route. 
It is yet to feature totaling features and forms being able to input data.

## Running unit tests

There exists no code for unit tests. I'll add once I learn how or if it becomes necessary later.

## Running end-to-end tests

No. Nada. Zilch
